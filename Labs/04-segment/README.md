# 4 Segment
## Lab assignment

1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). Submit:
    * Figure or table with connection of 7-segment displays on Nexys A7 board,
    * Decoder truth table for common anode 7-segment display.

2. Seven-segment display decoder. Submit:
    * Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `hex_7seg.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file `tb_hex_7seg.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs,
    * Listing of VHDL code from source file `top.vhd` with 7-segment module instantiation.

3. LED(7:4) indicators. Submit:
    * Truth table and listing of VHDL code for LEDs(7:4) with syntax highlighting,
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs.
