1. A half adder has two inputs A and B and two outputs Carry and Sum. Complete the half adder truth table. Draw a logic diagram of both output functions.

    | **B** | **A** | **Carry** | **Sum** |
    | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
    | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
    | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

2. A full adder has three inputs and two outputs. The two inputs are A, B, and Carry input. The outputs are Carry output and Sum. Complete the full adder truth table and draw a logic diagram of both output functions.

    | **Cin** | **B** | **A** | **Cout** | **Sum** |

    | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

3. Find the relationship between half adder and full adder logic diagrams.

Full adder is basically combination of two half adders. The difference is it has 3 input values.

The Nexys A7 board provides two four-digit common anode seven-segment LED displays (configured to behave like a single eight-digit display). See schematic or reference manual of the Nexys A7 board and find out the connection of 7-segment displays, ie to which FPGA pins are connected and how.
