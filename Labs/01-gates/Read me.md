Code from EDU [playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/DcV5):

```vhdl
architecture dataflow of gates is
begin
    f_o  <= (not b_i and a_i) or (not b_i and not c_i);
    fnand_o <= not(not((not b_i) and a_i) and not(not c_i and not b_i));
    fnor_o <= not(b_i or not a_i) or not(c_i or b_i);

end architecture dataflow;
