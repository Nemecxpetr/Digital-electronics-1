# 3 Vivado

## Lab assignment

1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). Submit:
    * Figure or table with connection of 16 slide switches and 16 LEDs on Nexys A7 board.

2. Two-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer. Submit:
    * Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file `tb_mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting,
    * Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs.

3. A Vivado tutorial. Submit:
    * Your tutorial for Vivado design flow: project creation, adding source file, adding testbench file, running simulation, (adding XDC constraints file).
